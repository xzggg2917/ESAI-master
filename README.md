Green analytical chemistry (GAC) seeks to reduce the environmental and health impacts of analytical procedures. Evaluating the greenness of analytical methods requires a holistic approach, considering reagents, energy use, waste generation, instrumentation, and cost. Existing metrics often lack flexibility or fail to cover all analytical stages. This study introduces a new algorithm integrating the 12 GAC principles and 10 sample preparation principles, establishing an eight-dimensional framework: sample collection, sample preparation, analytical technique, reagents, method performance, operational safety, economic evaluation, and waste disposal. The metric incorporates 27 weighted criteria, with results visualized via an octagonal radar chart, where color gradients and scores quantitatively represent greenness. Three different analytical methods were used as case studies to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the metric to evaluate the greenness of analytical methods. An open-source software implementation is available at https://mostwiedzy.pl/AGREE. This tool provides a systematic, transparent, and user-friendly approach to evaluating analytical method sustainability.
